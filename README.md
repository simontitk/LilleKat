# LilleKat
Solutions to exercises on the [Kattis] (https://open.kattis.com/)  platform, which has algorithmic problems with varying levels of complexity.
TTU hosts a problem solving session ~every second week, where students can team up and compete against others.
All of my solutions are in Java, some in Python, and recently started using JS as well.

# LilleKat
Solutions to exercises on the [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/)  platform, which has algorithmic problems with varying levels of complexity.
ITU hosts a problem solving session every second week, where students can team up and compete against others.
I have all of my solutions in Java, some in Python, and recently started using JS as well.
